# Gennessence Water App â€” Project Scope & Memory-Bank

## Outstanding Items & Current Focus (as of latest build)

### 1. Chunk Splitting & Performance
- Manual chunking is now in place for major libraries and admin pages using Vite/Rollup.
- Some large chunks remain, but initial load is improved and code splitting is optimal for most users.
- Further chunk optimization can be revisited if needed, but not blocking for mobile testing.

### 2. Outstanding UI/UX Issues (Mobile)
- **Mobile menu spacing:** Hamburger/nav menu has inconsistent or uneven spacing on mobile.
- **Product details page cut-off:** Product details content is being cut off or not fully visible on mobile devices.
- **General mobile responsiveness:** Audit and fix any fixed widths, overflows, or layout issues across all main pages/components.

### 3. Next Focus
- Fix all mobile UI/UX issues for a flawless, production-grade experience on Android/iOS.
- After mobile UI is perfect, resume work on admin functionality and advanced features.
