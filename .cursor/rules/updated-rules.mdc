All projects should follow a cross-platform design philosophy.

## 📱 Platform Targets

Every app must be planned and built for:
- ✅ Web
- ✅ Android (Play Store)
- ✅ iOS (App Store)
- ✅ Optional: Desktop (Electron, PWA)

Use frameworks and libraries that support multiplatform targets:
- React Native (❌ Do not use Expo – use React Native CLI with Capacitor instead)
- React or Next.js (with Vite preferred) for web
- Tailwind CSS or styled-components for consistent UI styling
- Capacitor for native app packaging

## 🧩 Development Priorities

Prioritize:
- ✅ Responsive layouts
- ✅ Device-agnostic design
- ✅ Offline capabilities where appropriate
- ✅ Deployment-ready build systems

## 📦 Code Architecture

All code should be:
- Platform-agnostic by default
- Easily modularized
- Lightweight with scalable structure
- Reusable across platforms

Every time you generate a component, page, or utility:
- ✅ Ensure it works on both web and mobile (React Native or PWA)
- ✅ Use file naming that supports shared logic across platforms
- ✅ Follow the app store readiness approach – no web-only solutions unless explicitly approved

## ⏳ Post-Core Development Roadmap: Empowerment Distribution System

Once all planned primary features are completed, the app must expand to support Gennessence Water’s distributor empowerment strategy. This system should be designed as a cross-platform business opportunity module for micro-entrepreneurs.

### 🎯 Key Features to Implement:

- **Distributor Onboarding:** In-app registration for tiers (T1–T4)
- **Stock Ordering System:** Real-time ordering and inventory tracking
- **Earnings Dashboard:** Sales, margin tracking, and commission breakdowns
- **Training Hub:** Courses on water knowledge, sales, branding, entrepreneurship
- **Gamified Rewards:** Milestones, badges, territory leaderboards
- **Referral Tools:** Distributor QR codes, links, sub-agent tracking
- **Buy-Back Flow:** Interface for returning unsold stock (if seal intact)
- **Regional Admin Panel:** For T3/T4 distributors to manage networks
- **Equity Ladder Monitoring:** Tracks eligibility for shares or profit split

### 📲 Requirements for Distribution Features:

- ✅ Must follow all cross-platform rules
- ✅ Offline fallback support for township/low-bandwidth areas
- ✅ Secure account management and role-based access
- ✅ Localized language/pricing support
- ✅ Analytics integration (e.g. Firebase, PostHog)

> Begin this feature set *only after* all initial hydration-focused and consumer-facing modules are live and stable.
