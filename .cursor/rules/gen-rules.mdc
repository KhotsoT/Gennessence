### Core Philosophy
This is a clean, cross-platform app for Gennessence Water — health-focused, calm design, mobile-first. The project should always be built with maximum stability and clarity in mind.

### Cross-Platform Rule (Mandatory)
- Must work on:
  - ✅ Web
  - ✅ Android (Play Store)
  - ✅ iOS (App Store)
- Uses **Capacitor** for native builds
- No Expo — ever
- Built using **Yarn** (not npm)

### CLI Environment
- All commands must be compatible with **Windows Powershell**
- Never use `&&` in terminal commands
- Use `;` or newline-separated commands instead

### Stack
- Vite (React template)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Zustand or React Context for state
- Yarn for all dependency management
- Capacitor for mobile deployment

### UI/UX Design
- Water-themed palette and components
- Reusable, responsive, clean layouts
- Brand colors based on pH values (7.0 to 11.5)

# Gennessence Water App — Project Scope & Memory-Bank

## 1. Brand/Product Structure
- **Main Page:** Our Waters (formerly Benefits)
- **Categories:**
  - Health Water (Pure Water, Gentle Boost, Optimal Balance, Detox Water)
  - Beauty Water (Beauty Water)
  - Utility Water (Shield, PureKlean)
- **Product Data:**
  - All product names, pH values, color codes, and benefit points are preserved and mapped to the correct category.
- **Design:**
  - Cards use luxury glassmorphism, gradients, premium fonts, and are responsive (1 per row on mobile, 2 per row for Health Water on desktop/tablet).

## 2. Design System
- **Typography:** Montserrat (via @fontsource), with clear hierarchy and luxury styling.
- **Color Palette:** Brand blues (#3074db, #2581c4, #1b8ec2), pinks, oranges, and gradients for section headers/icons.
- **Card Design:** Soft, floating, rounded, with pill-shaped pH badges, centered content, and a water-themed icon in the lower right.
- **Responsiveness:** All layouts are mobile-first, with grid adjustments for different breakpoints.

## 3. Navigation & Routing
- **Nav Link:** "Our Waters" (not "Benefits"), links to `/our-waters` everywhere (desktop, mobile, and route).
- **All references to `/benefits` have been removed.**

## 4. Component/Codebase Decisions
- **Component Reuse:** All cards and sections are modular and styled with styled-components for easy future updates.
- **Icons:** FaTint, FaSpa, FaWater used for category icons, with gradients and responsive sizing.
- **No Expo:** All code is cross-platform, Expo-free, and ready for web, Android, iOS, and desktop (via Capacitor/PWA).

## 5. Admin/User Management (Current State)
- **Admin Auth:** Admin authentication, protected routes, and context are in place.
- **User Management:** User CRUD, role assignment, and admin dashboard are scaffolded.
- **Next:** Assign admin role to yourself, test admin features, and refine user management UI/UX.
