### Core Philosophy
This is a clean, cross-platform app for Gennessence Water — health-focused, calm design, mobile-first. The project should always be built with maximum stability and clarity in mind.

### Cross-Platform Rule (Mandatory)
- Must work on:
  - ✅ Web
  - ✅ Android (Play Store)
  - ✅ iOS (App Store)
- Uses **Capacitor** for native builds
- No Expo — ever
- Built using **Yarn** (not npm)

### CLI Environment
- All commands must be compatible with **Windows Powershell**
- Never use `&&` in terminal commands
- Use `;` or newline-separated commands instead

### Stack
- Vite (React template)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Zustand or React Context for state
- Yarn for all dependency management
- Capacitor for mobile deployment

### UI/UX Design
- Water-themed palette and components
- Reusable, responsive, clean layouts
- Brand colors based on pH values (7.0 to 11.5)
